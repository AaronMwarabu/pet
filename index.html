        <p>Danny the dog spends most of his time playing with the kite.He also loves running after me when am riding my bicycle</p>
        <p>He is also used to sleeping immediately eating his favourite food meat.When we go hunting he also enjoys chasing after the rabbits and the squirrels.</p>
        <p>
            If there was ever a food-motivated dog, this is he. His stash of treats sits atop the fridge, so whenever anyone enters the kitchen he will sit his very best sit at the entryway hoping someone will reward him for it.

    He is also a big fan of my treat songs, which have such incredibly deep lyrics as: “Would you liiiike a treat-treat-treat, treat-treat-treat? You are good and you are sweet. Would you like a little treat?”

    C’mon, if you were a dog you’d be excited too.
        </p>
        <p>His favorite toys are my ball and my pair of jordan one shoes which he spends most of the time biting them.</p>
